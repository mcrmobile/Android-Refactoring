# Exercise

This project is a very basic Android app that displays a list of vehicles from a network request.

The project is not well-written, please suggest improvements to the project. However, be careful what you choose to refactor as this may take a lot of your time.

The project contains two modules:

* "compose" uses Jetpack Compose, please select this module if you are comfortable writing compose code
* "xml" uses more traditional XML layouts, please select this module if you are more comfortable using XML layouts

## Part 1 (approx 20 mins)

The bulk of the implementation is in ComposeMainActivity.kt or XmlMainActivity.kt

Spend 5 minutes discussing some improvements to the current implementation based on your experience and knowledge of Android and Software Engineering best practises with your interviewers.

Think about:
* Architecture
* Android guidance
* Performance
* Maintainability
* Scalability

Now spend 15 minutes refactoring MainActivity.kt based on these discussions

## Part 2 (approx 30 mins)

Please review these tickets and implement them to a high standard.
